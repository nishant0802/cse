              I would consider it a privilege to help your family say farewell
              to your loved one, as they would have wished. This is obviously a
              difficult time for you and I would like to give you all the help
              and support that you need, at your own pace.<br />
              I am Staffordshire-based and am familiar with the crematoriums at
              Fradley, Sutton Coldfield and Stafford. <br />However, services
              can be whereever you wish.

                I am knowledgeable in all aspects of planning for and delivering
                funeral services and memorials. My training with the Institute
                of Professional Celebrants included guidance on conducting the
                most sensitive and difficult funerals, such as for small
                children, suicides, and estranged family members, as well as for
                the more straightforward.

                "Lesley acted as celebrant for my father's funeral. On our first
                meeting to discuss the service we wanted, Lesley was so kind and
                caring. She helped us find our way through tricky family
                relationships and brought out the best of my father to our
                minds. She advised us, held our hands and spent a lot of time
                researching my Dad's interests finding appropriate poems and
                music for us. Resultingin a lovely service that was an amazing
                representation of Dad. As we were in a covid lockdown situation
                it needed extra care which Lesley gave. The service ran very
                smoothly no hiccups thanks to Lesley's professionalism. I have
                no hesitation in recommending Lesley for any celebration."
